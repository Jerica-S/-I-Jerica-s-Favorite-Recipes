   <h2>Noodle Instructions</h2>
   <div class="noodle-instructions">
    

    In a mixing bowl add 240g of all purpose flour along with your alkaline water mixture. Stir to combine with a large wooden spoon. You want to make a shaggy but cohesive ball of dough. If needed add a little extra water.

    Once it’s combined, pat into a disc, dust it with bread flour, and cover. Let it rest for 30 minutes.

    Once it’s rested for 30 minutes, remove from bowl and lightly dust it with flour. Roll your dough out and then fold into thirds, and then into thirds again. Roll out just a little bit and then wrap in plastic wrap and let rest for 30 more minutes.

    On a stand mixer attach your pasta attachment. Remove dough from plastic wrap and dust with bread flour. Give it one pass on your pasta rollers widest setting. Fold into thirds, rotate 90° and pass it through again on your pasta press at about a 2 or 3. If it seems to long, give it a chop in half. 

    Dust with bread flour again, before passing though your noodle cutter attachment. Add some more bread flour and twist into little nests on a rimmed baking sheet that’s also been dusted with bread flour.

    Place noodles in boiling water and cook no longer than 3 minutes checking for doneness at 90 seconds.

        <li>Start by baking baking soda in a 250°F oven for 1 hour. Add 2 tsp of mixture with 4 ounces plus 2 Tbsp of water making sure it dissolves completely. </li>
